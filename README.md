This project uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to incorporate data into the direct problem of finding the equilibrium deformed state of an elastic material under external forces. The work was developed under the supervision of Dr. Michelle Carey as part of an MSc in Data Science from University College Dublin, Ireland.
